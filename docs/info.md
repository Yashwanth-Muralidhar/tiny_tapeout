## How it works

This project implements a streaming ML-KEM (Kyber) coefficient field-operation engine. It supports all three
standard parameter sets -- ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 -- selected at `start` time via the `param`
bits on `uio_in`.

The design has two operating phases, selected by the `phase` bit on `uio_in` at `start`:

- **phase = 0 (decompression / output):** the host streams ciphertext bytes in. The engine unpacks each
  bit-packed coefficient (`du`-bit width for the first `c1_len` coefficients, `dv`-bit width for the remainder),
  decompresses it via a bit-serial repeated-doubling accumulator, and streams the decompressed 12-bit value back
  out as two bytes per coefficient.
- **phase = 1 (auxiliary-reference verification):** the host streams ciphertext bytes in as before, but for
  every unpacked coefficient the engine also requests a 12-bit auxiliary reference value from the host
  (`S_RXA`), recompresses it via the same bit-serial engine, and compares the result against the coefficient
  taken directly from the ciphertext stream. A running (sticky) mismatch flag accumulates across all
  coefficients.

When the expected coefficient count for the selected parameter set has been consumed, the design enters
`S_DONE` and reports a 2-bit status on `uo_out[1:0]`:

- `uo_out[0]` (`MATCH`) -- set if phase 1 ran and no mismatch was ever detected.
- `uo_out[1]` (`FAULT`) -- set if the number of coefficients processed did not match the expected total for
  the selected parameter set (a framing/length error), also mirrored on `uio_out[7]`.

`uio_out[6]` (`busy`) is high whenever the design is actively unpacking, decompressing, comparing, or has
output pending.

### Byte protocol (`uio_in`)

| Bit | Name    | Meaning                                                          |
| --- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | `wr`    | Strobe: latch `ui_in` as the next input byte                      |
| 1   | `start` | Strobe: begin a new transaction (also latches `phase` and `param`)|
| 2   | `rd`    | Strobe: advance to the next pending output byte                   |
| 3   | `phase` | 0 = decompress/output, 1 = auxiliary-reference verify             |
| 5:4 | `param` | 0 = ML-KEM-512, 1 = ML-KEM-768, 2 = ML-KEM-1024                   |

All strobes are rising-edge, single-cycle pulses (assert for one clock, then deassert).

## How to test

1. Assert `start` (with `phase`/`param` set as desired) for one clock cycle.
2. Feed ciphertext bytes one at a time: wait until `busy` (`uio_out[6]`) allows a write, present the byte on
   `ui_in`, and pulse `wr`.
3. **Phase 1 only:** whenever the design requests it, supply the 12-bit auxiliary reference coefficient for
   the coefficient currently being processed, two bytes low-then-high-nibble, each written with a `wr` pulse.
4. **Phase 0 only:** whenever output is pending, pulse `rd` to read each of the two output bytes per
   coefficient (low byte first, then the high nibble).
5. After the last ciphertext byte, wait for `busy` to deassert with the design in `S_DONE`; read the
   `MATCH`/`FAULT` result from `uo_out[1:0]`.

The `test/test.py` cocotb suite exercises all three parameter sets, boundary-position tamper injection
(phase 1), and full decompression-output verification against a Python golden model (phase 0). Run with:

```sh
cd test
make -B
```

## External hardware

None. This project is a pure digital logic block; it communicates only over the standard Tiny Tapeout
`ui_in`/`uo_out`/`uio_*` pins and needs no external hardware to operate.
